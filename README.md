# TUBav

## What is this?

It's an avatars' generator inspired of the equipment system in "[The Ultimatest Battle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/669580/The_Ultimatest_Battle/)" game.

## Why?

This project aims to replace the avatar generator that can be found on their [website](https://www.ediogames.com/fr/users/nubgenerator). It is now difficult to use it because of Flash deprecation.

## What's up with this name?

- It's funny.
- "TUB" for The Ultimatest Battle and "av" for avatar
- It's short and easy to remember.
